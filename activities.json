To do this, first spend half the structure's listed RP and Commodity cost, and then attempt the specified check. The existing structure gives you a +2 item bonus to the check.

In this case, no roll is needed and you simply deduct the appropriate amount of funds from your personal wealth to pay back that which was borrowed. When you use Capital Investment to generate RP, the amount of gp required to make an investment is set by your kingdom's level. Investments below this amount cause your attempt at Capital Investment to suffer an automatic critical failure, while investments above this amount are lost. The investment required is equal to the value listed on Table 10\u20139: Party Treasure by Level in the Pathfinder Core Rulebook (page 509); use the value for your kingdom's level under the 'Currency per Additional PC' as the required investment value.

Other ongoing events may have ongoing Unrest adjustments as well; make them at this time.\n\nAfter making all adjustments, if your kingdom's Unrest is 10 or higher, the kingdom gains 1d10 points to its Ruins. Distribute these points in any way you wish among the four Ruins. In addition, attempt a DC 11 flat check. On a failure, one hex of your kingdom is lost; the PCs choose which hex. See Losing Hexes for more information.\n\nIf your kingdom's Unrest is 20 or higher, the entire nation also falls into anarchy. While in anarchy, you can only attempt Quell Unrest activities, and the results of all kingdom checks are worsened one degree."
