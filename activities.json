To do this, first spend half the structure's listed RP and Commodity cost, and then attempt the specified check. The existing structure gives you a +2 item bonus to the check.

You cannot have fewer than 0 Resource Dice.\nResource Dice = kingdom level + 4 + bonus dice \u2013 penalty dice\n\nNext, roll your Resource Dice to determine how many Resource Points (RP) you have available during this turn.
